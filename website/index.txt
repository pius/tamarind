h2. What

Tamarind was designed to make it as easy as possible for developers to participate in the Semantic Web by exposing their data in accordance with applicable standards and ontologies.  In particular, Tamarind targets developers using Ruby frameworks and ORMs.

h2. Installing

1.  Git it.  (<pre syntax="ruby">git clone git://github.com/pius/tamarind.git</pre>)
2.  Install the gem.  (<pre syntax="ruby">cd tamarind; rake local_deploy</pre>)

h2. Demonstration of usage

==Adding New Ontologies

To add an ontology, a developer need only follow these steps:

1.  Under tamarind/branches, create a directory for the ontology along with a module that identifies the data fields
	necessary for filling in the ontology.  (See the FOAF ontology as an example.)
2.  Write the template using Ruby builder syntax and save it under the directory from step 1.  Fields that must come from 
	the database should be prefixed by the "@" sign.  (Again, see the FOAF ontology as an example.)
3.  There is no step three.

==General Process for Using Ontologies In Your Application

To use an ontology, a developer need only follow these steps:

1.  Require the gem in your application
2.  Check out the documentation for the gem to find what ontologies are supported and learn how to use the "offers_*" 
	methods.
3.  In your model file, call offers_<ontology>, where <ontology> is the lowercase RDF type (e.g. offers_foaf).
	
====Instructions for Merb (0.9.1 or greater)

*in config/init.rb

Merb::BootLoader.before_app_loads do
 dependency 'tamarind'
end

Merb::BootLoader.after_app_loads do
  Merb.add_mime_type(:rdf,:to_rdf,%w[application/rdf+xml])
end

*in any controller that's going to use Tamarind, add:

provides :rdf

*in the model (e.g. User), add:
	offers_foaf :name => 'username', 
				:email => 'email',  #takes a hash mapping the ontology's canonical attributes to the model's accessors
							#defaults to using the same names

*in any view (e.g. the User show action) using Tamarind, add this to enable auto-discovery:
<link rel="meta" type="application/rdf+xml" title="foo" href="<%=@user.id%>.rdf" />
